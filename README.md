Most web applications have a similar structure and when starting small web projects it is important to avoid wasting 
time with the setup of a basic structure.  This generators aims at creating a initial project structure that is 
lightweight enough for a small startup projects but nevertheless apply patterns that allow scaling out to a major 
application. Just perfect to quickly launch a website and validate a brilliant startup idea :)  

## Structure
The application consist of the following component: 

1. Angular.js Web App 
2. Api Project
3. Utility scripts that help development and deployment
4. Landing Page (not yet implemented)

When starting a new project you never know where it will end up and flexibility is the key to meet future, yet unknown 
requirements. The separation between landing page, api and web app allows scaling out the application to the specific 
needs.
